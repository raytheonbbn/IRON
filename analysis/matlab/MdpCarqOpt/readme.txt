This directory contains code for analyzing the behavior of an optimally
configured round-based Coded ARQ (CARQ) error control approach. The analysis
uses a Markov Deciion Process (MDP) model of the encoding and transmission
mechanism, and uses a Dynamic Program to determine the best strategy given
the MDP model.

This directory also contains code for visualizing the performance results,
as well as visualizing the performance differences against the
Adaptive Error Control (AEC) algorithm.

mdpCarqOpt.m
	Main optimization controller script

MDPCARQ_K.m
	Dynamic Program that performs the CARQ optimization

mdpCarqResults.txt
	Results produced by running mdpCarqOpt.m

plotMdpCarqResults.m
	Script the generates a 3D visualization of mdpCarqResults.txt

mdpCarqResults.png
	PNG image of the plot generated by plotMdpCarqResults

aeccarqresults.txt
	Results produced by running the AEC simulator.
	aecsim > aeccarqresults.txt

plotMdpAecDelta.m
	Script the generates a 3D visualization of the performance
	differences between the MDP solution and the AEC algorithm.
	This uses as input both mdpCarqResults.txt and aeccarqresults.txt
