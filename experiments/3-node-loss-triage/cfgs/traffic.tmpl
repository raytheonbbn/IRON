#
#  Traffic directives have the following format:
#
#  For TCP and UDP flows:
#
#  protocol src dest num_flows src_port dst_port start_time end_time packet_size data_rate
#
#  The TCP and UDP flow parameters are defined as follows:
#
#  protocol    : tcp or udp
#  src         : The source node, in configuration template replacement
#                string format (e.g. $enclave1_app1_node$).
#  dest        : The destination node, in configuration template
#                replacement string format (e.g. $enclave2_app1_node$).
#  num_flows   : The number of flows with this specification.
#  src_port    : The source port for the flow. If num_flows > 1,
#                then the source port is incremented for each flow.
#  dst_port    : The destination port for the flow. If num_flows > 1,
#                then the destination port is incremented for each flow.
#  start_time  : The start time for the flow.
#  end_time    : The end time for the flow.
#  packet_size : The size of data packets.
#  data_rate   : The average source rate.
#
#  For short_tcp flows:
#
#  protocol src dest num_flows lo_port hi_port start_time end_time flow_size_bytes interflow_duration
#
#  A "short_tcp" flow is a series of short TCP flows, started
#  sequentially.  Each flow attempts to deliver flow_size_bytes of
#  data and the flows in a series are interflow_duration apart. The
#  ports chosen for each flow in a series (and across all series) are
#  chosen between the lo_port and hi_port range. For these short-tcp
#  flows, the source port is always set to the destination port by the
#  scripts. If there are not enough ports in the range to support all
#  the requested short flows with a unique port, then script will fail
#  and return an error (which will abort the experiment if using the
#  run_exp.sh script). Each flow will run for a maximum of 2 seconds
#  from the start time, or time taken to transmit the specified amount
#  of data (flow_size_bytes), whichever comes first.
#
#  The short_tcp flow parameters are defined as follows:
#
#  protocol           : short_tcp
#  src                : The source node, in configuration template
#                       replacement string format
#                       (e.g. $enclave1_app1_node$).
#  dest               : The destination node, in configuration template
#                       replacement string format
#                       (e.g. $enclave2_app1_node$).
#  num_flows          : The number of flows with this specification.
#  lo_port            : The lower bound for source port number for
#                       this flow.
#  dst_port           : The destination port for the flow. If
#                       num_flows > 1, then the destination port is
#                       incremented for each flow.
#  start_time         : The start time for the series of short flows.
#  end_time           : The end time for the series of short flows.
#  flow_size_bytes    : The amount of data, in bytes, that should be
#                       transferred in a single short flow.
#  interflow_duration : The average time between successive short
#                       flows, in seconds. This is randomly incremented
#                       or decremented by up to 10%.

# The following are examples of flows from application host 1 in
# Enclave 1 to application host 1 in Enclave 2:
#
# Example to start 10 udp flows:
# udp $enclave1_app1_node$ $enclave2_app1_node$ 10 30777 30777 10.0 50.0 1024 3Mbps
#
# Example to start 2 TCP flows, each with a different start and end time:
# tcp $enclave1_app1_node$ $enclave2_app1_node$ 1 29778 29778 10.0 50.0 1016 25Mbps
# tcp $enclave1_app1_node$ $enclave2_app1_node$ 1 29779 29779 20.0 40.0 1008 25Mbps

tcp $enclave1_app1_node$ $enclave2_app1_node$ 1 30777 30777 5.0 70.0 1024 20Mbps
udp $enclave1_app1_node$ $enclave2_app1_node$ 1 40000 40000 10.0 70.0 1024 3500Kbps
udp $enclave1_app1_node$ $enclave2_app1_node$ 1 41000 41000 10.0 70.0 1024 3500Kbps
