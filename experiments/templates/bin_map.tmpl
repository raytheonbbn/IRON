# IRON: end
#
# IRON uses one bin for each enclave. BinIds are used as unique identifiers
# for the enclaves that must be universally understood by all enclaves. BinIds
# are carried on the wire in backpressure signaling protocol packets.
#
# Enclaves are divided into two types: destination enclaves and interior
# enclaves. Destination enclaves are those with attached application networks.
# Interior enclaves are those without any attached application networks.
# Application packets are always forwarded to destination enclaves, never to
# interior enclaves. Each destination enclave definition includes a list of
# subnet masks, called HostMasks, for all of the attached application
# networks. Interior enclaves have no HostMasks in their definitions.
#
# BinIds do not need to be consecutive, but they must be within the ranges
# specified by common/include/iron_constants.h. Specifically, destination
# enclave BinIds must be in the range 0 to kMaxUcastBinId, and interior
# enclave BinIds must be in the range 0 to kMaxBinId. Both of these BinIds
# must be representable by the type BinId defined in
# common/include/iron_types.h.
#
# The maximum number of bins (enclaves) supported by IRON is specified in
# common/include/iron_constants.h. The maximum number of destination enclaves
# is kMaxNumDests, while the maximum number of interior enclaves is
# kMaxNumIntNodes.
#
# Multicast packets are application packets that are destined to one or more
# destination enclaves. Each multicast group consists of the multicast IPv4
# address used as the destination address in these packets, and the list of
# destination enclave BinIds that the packets should be forwarded to. Each
# multicast group is assigned a McastId instead of a BinId. The McastId is
# automatically generated from the multicast IPv4 address at run time, so it
# is not specified in this configuration file. The McastId type is defined in
# common/include/iron_types.h. The maximum number of multicast groups that may
# be defined is kMaxNumMcastGroups, as specified in
# common/include/iron_constants.h.
#
# The multicast group 224.77.77.77 is automatically used for sending GRAM
# packets between enclaves when GRAMs are enabled in the backpressure
# forwarder.
#
# If any of the above configuration rules are broken, the system will abort
# with a fatal log message during start up.
#
# This is an example BinMap configuration file. It should be modified to
# support the desired system configuration. Following is a description of the
# values that are provided during the configuration of the BinMap.
#
# BinMap.BinIds               : Comma separated list of unicast destination
#                               BinIds for destination enclaves. The default
#                               value is: "". 0 is a valid BinId. These BinIds
#                               cannot exceed kMaxUcastBinId as defined in
#                               iron_constants.h. Each BinId listed here must
#                               have a corresponding "x.HostMasks" parameter,
#                               with "x" being the BinId value.
# BinMap.BinId.x.HostMasks    : Comma separated list of host masks associated
#                               with destination enclave BinId "x". An example
#                               is: 192.168.1.0/24,10.1.1.0/24. If a '/num'
#                               prefix length is not provided, then '/32' is
#                               assigned. The default value is: "". This
#                               defines the attached application network IPv4
#                               addresses that are part of this destination
#                               enclave and are used to determine when packets
#                               have reached their destination enclave (and
#                               thus should be pulled out of backpressure
#                               forwarding and delivered to the proxies).
# BinMap.IntBinIds            : Comma separated list of interior enclave
#                               BinIds. The default value is: "". 0 is a valid
#                               BinId. These BinIds cannot exceed kMaxBinId as
#                               defined in iron_constants.h.
# BinMap.NumMcastGroups       : The number of multicast groups. The default
#                               value is: "0". Each multicast group is defined
#                               using ".y.Addr" and ".y.Members" parameters,
#                               with "y" being a monotonic increasing counter
#                               from 0 to the number of multicast groups minus
#                               one.
# BinMap.McastGroup.y.Addr    : The multicast IPv4 destination address
#                               associated with the "y"th multicast group in
#                               dot-decimal notations.  An example is:
#                               224.4.8.12
# BinMap.McastGroup.y.Members : Comma separated list of multicast group
#                               member unicast destination bin ids associated
#                               with the "y"th . An example
#                               is: 0,1,2,3.
