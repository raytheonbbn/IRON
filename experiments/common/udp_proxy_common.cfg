# Configuration for the IRON UDP proxy.
#

########################## LOGGING ###########################################
#
# The default log level, specified as any combination of the letters F
# (Fatal), E (Error), W (Warning), I (Information), A (Analysis), and
# D (Debug).
#
# Default value: FEWIAD
#
Log.DefaultLevel FEW

#
# Set class specific log levels. These override the DefaultLevel just for
# log messages within the specified class.
#
# Log.ClassLevels    <class1>=FEWAID;<class2>=FEWI
# For maximum packet tracking, use:
# Log.ClassLevels    Packet=FEWAID;PacketPool=FEWAID

#
# The name of the log file. Can instead be specified via the command line
# (which takes precidence).
#
# Log.File udp_proxy.log

########################## UDP PROXY BEHAVIOR ################################

#
# Minimum time window between admission control timers in microseconds.
#
# Increasing this will increase CPU performance at the expense of making
# traffic more bursty.
#
# Default value is 2000.
#
# BpfMinBurstUsec 2000

#
# Maximum amount of time packets will be held while waiting for earlier
# packets in the same flow.
#
# Packets from latency-sensitive (DHCP=EF) flows that have a non-infinite
# time-to-go will be held for the minimum of this time or the time to go (or
# until all earlier packets have been received). Packets from latency
# insensitive flows will be held for at most this long.
#
# Default value is 0.0. i.e., no reordering.
#
# MaxHoldTimeSec 0.0

# The maximum size (in packets) of the encoded_pkts_queue per flow.
# Once packets are encoded, they are stored in this queue until they are
# admitted into the network by admissions control.
#
# MaxQueueDepthPerFlowPkts 500

#
# How often, in microseconds, to update the queue depths from shared memory.
#
# This parameter effectively manages the freshness of information from the
# BPF. The BPF queues are updated continually as packets arrive and
# depart. Every QueueDepthUpdateIntervalUs microseconds, (or as soon after
# that as the processor is free), the updated queue depths are copied into the
# UDP proxy for local use.
#
# Default value is 1000.
#
# QueueDepthUpdateIntervalUs 1000

#
# Define the garbage collection cleanup interval in seconds.
#
# Default value is 120 seconds.
#
# GCIntervalSec 120

#
# Define the decoder cleanup timeout interval in seconds.
#
# Default value is 120 seconds
#
# DecoderTimeoutSec 120

################ INTERFACE WITH ADMISSION PLANNER ############################

# The statistics collection interval, in milliseconds. When this
# interval expires, the collected statistics are cleared and logged if
# LogStatistics is true.
#
# These statistics are used to communicate values to the admission planner.
# They can also be used for debugging and/or custom operation views.
#
# Default value: 5000
#
# StatsCollectionIntervalMs  5000

# Controls if the collected statistics are written to the Log file.
#
# Default value: true
#
# LogStatistics  true

########################## EXPERIMENTATION ###################################
#
# Indicate whether to overwrite the sequence number and tx timestamp of an MGEN
# packet.
# NOTE: This should only be set to true if the packets are sent over UDP by
# MGEN.  Do not set if sourced by anything other than MGEN!
# none: Do nothing (no overwrite) -- default.
# ow-time: Overwrite timestamp with class Time object (consistent with logs).
# ow-wallclock: Overwrite timestamp with wall clock (for delay comp in ws).
#
# This is useful for measuring IRON-induced latency in MGEN experiments.
MGENDiagnosticsMode ow-wallclock


######################### PLUMBING ###########################################

#
# Define the UDP proxy control port.
# If this isn't set, either here or on the command line, then
# it defaults to 3144
#
# Udp.RemoteControl.Port 3144

#
# The device facing the local network (vs. internet or management subnet).
#
# Default value: em2
#
# InboundDevName em2

# defaultService is intended as a catch-all to define the behavior whenever
# there is no applicable service definition. There is a default service
# definition defined in the code, but it can be overwritten with this
# parameter.
#
# defaultService 1-65535;1/1;1500;0;0;120;0;type=LOG:a=20:m=10000000:p=1:label=default_service
