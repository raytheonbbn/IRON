emuHAIPE has a number of settable options. You can type "./emuHAIPE -h" to get
a listing, however the best place to see the various configuration options is
int the example configuartion file emuHaipe.cfg included in this directory.

The emulator assumes otherwise quite reasonable default values for 
the set of parameters, but if you don't like or can't use the default 
settings, you can override them either with command line parameters or change 
them in a properties file and give the name of the property file 
to emuNet (./emuHAIPE -P filename).

Or both. Command line options have precedence over the same
settings in the property file when both are defined.

An example properties file is provide (emuHaipe.cfg), which documents
all of the currently configurable parameters in the provided code.
The emuNet.cfg file is probably the best current source for descriptions
of the various parameters (-h only provides a summary listing).

More documentation to follow.
