# A configuration file for all HAIPE emulator parameters
#

# Define the device facing the protected network (vs internet or
# management subnet). If this isn't set, either here or on 
# the command line, then it defaults to "all" which means
# apply HAIPE decapsulation to any HAIPE packets destined 
# to any interfaces
#
# RedSide_PhyDevName eth0

# Define the device facing the unprotected network (vs local subnet
# or management subnet). If this isn't set, either here or on 
# the command line, then it defaults to "all" which means
# apply HAIPE encapsulation to any non-HAIPE packets destined 
# to any interfaces
#
# BlackSide_PhyDevName eth1

# Define the VIF device
# If this isn't set, either here or on the command line, then
# it defaults to haipe0
#
# VIFDevName haipe0

# Define the various network parameters needed to configure the
# VIF when we "ifconfig" it to the up state. Specifically, the 
# parameters are the address, netmask, and broadcast address
# assigned to the VIF.
#
# If they aren't set here or on the command line, then they default
# to 10.129.129.129, 255.255.255.252, and 10.129.129.131 respectively
#
# VIFAddress 10.129.129.129
# VIFNetmask 255.255.255.252
# VIFBroadcast 10.129.129.131

# Specify whether external or internal plumbing will be used
# If this isn't set, either here or on the command line, then
# it defaults to 0 (internal plumbing)
#
# ExternalPlumbing 0

# Define the iptables command
# If this isn't set, either here or on the command line, then
# it defaults to /sbin/iptables
#
# IPTablesCmd /sbin/iptables

# Define the ip command (for adding rules and routes)
# If this isn't set, either here or on the command line, then
# it defaults to /sbin/ip
#
# IPCmd /sbin/ip

# Define the ifconfig command (for bringing up interfaces)
# If this isn't set, either here or on the command line, then
# it defaults to /sbin/ifconfig
#
# IFCmd /sbin/ifconfig

# Define the firewall mark
# If this isn't set, either here or on the command line, then
# it defaults to 4
#
# FirewallMark 4

# Define the alternate routing table number
# If this isn't set, either here or on the command line, then
# it defaults to 4
#
# VIFAltTable 4

# Define the amount of overhead in bytes to add for the encryption 
# header (e.g., ESP or HAIPE IS). If its not set here, it defaults 
# to 60 bytes
#
# HAIPE_Overhead 60
