This distribution has been modified to include support for window-based
flow control as an option, where window control is provided by IRON's
udp-proxy. Hence the reason this directory is called norm-1.5.8-bbn.

To build the NORM libraries for use with the GNAT nftp utility:

   ./build.sh

To clean up the NORM distribution in the GNAT repo:

   ./clean.sh
