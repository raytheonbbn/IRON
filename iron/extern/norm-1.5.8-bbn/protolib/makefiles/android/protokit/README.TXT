This directoy contains Android Studio project files for building Protolib as a
static library (libprotokit.a).

TO BUILD:

./gradlew build

The lib/build/ directory will contain the binary libraries built.

The "./gradlew clean" command can be used to delete the files built.

This directory may also be opened as an Android Studio project and built from
the IDE GUI.

This will evolve as we update Protolib and associated projects to the newer
Android Studio tool chain.
